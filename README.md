Selenium Framework

The idea behind this project is to create a default settings for webdriver testing and to gather all of the commonly used testing functions / constructions into one place.


What do we have in this project?
- A screenshot is being created when a test fails
- By defualt a Firefox driver is being created with certain settings.




Plans for the future (some of this are in progress):
- Support some basic db connections.
- Create a base for api testing using rest-assured libraries
- Automate the initial setup for chromeWebdriver and InternetExplorerWebdriver
- Make a tutorial
